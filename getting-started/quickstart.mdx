Now that you've got Pipecat installed, let's run your first example application. We'll use the "Say One Thing" example, which creates a simple bot that greets users when they join a room and exits when they leave.

## Getting the Example

Download the ["Say One Thing"](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/raw/main/examples/foundational/01-say-one-thing.py) example from the `pipecat` repo and save it to your project directory.

## Configuring the Example

The example uses Cartesia's text-to-speech service. Make sure you have your `.env` file set up with:

```env
DAILY_SAMPLE_ROOM_URL=https://YOURDOMAIN.daily.co/YOURROOM
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
```

The example uses a pre-configured voice. You can change this by modifying the `voice_id` parameter in the `CartesiaHttpTTSService` configuration.

## Running the Example

1. Open your Daily room URL in a browser tab
2. Join the room
3. Run the example:

```bash
python 01-say-one-thing.py
```

If all goes well, you should see another participant (named "Say One Thing") join the room, greet you, and disconnect when you leave the room.

## Understanding How It Works

Let's look at the key components of this example:

```python
# Configure Daily transport for WebRTC communication
# - room_url: Where to connect
# - None: No authentication token needed
# - "Say One Thing": Bot's display name
# - Enable audio output for text-to-speech playback
transport = DailyTransport(
    room_url,
    None,
    "Say One Thing",
    DailyParams(audio_out_enabled=True)
)

# Initialize Cartesia's text-to-speech service
# Using a pre-selected British female voice
# You can find other voices at play.cartesia.ai/library
tts = CartesiaHttpTTSService(
    api_key=os.getenv("CARTESIA_API_KEY"),
    voice_id="79a125e8-cd45-4c13-8a67-188112f4dd22",  # British Lady
)

# Create pipeline to process text into speech and play it
# 1. tts: Converts text messages into audio
# 2. transport.output(): Sends audio to the Daily room
pipeline = Pipeline([
    tts,
    transport.output()
])

# When the first person joins the room:
# - Extract their username from the participant info
# - Generate a greeting message
# - Queue it for text-to-speech conversion
@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    participant_name = participant.get("info", {}).get("userName", "")
    await task.queue_frame(TextFrame(f"Hello there, {participant_name}!"))

# When someone leaves the room:
# - Queue an EndFrame to gracefully shut down the application
# This ensures proper cleanup of resources
@transport.event_handler("on_participant_left")
async def on_participant_left(transport, participant, reason):
    await task.queue_frame(EndFrame())
```

This example demonstrates several core Pipecat concepts:

- Using a transport for audio output
- Setting up a TTS service
- Creating a simple processing pipeline
- Handling events and generating responses
- Managing application lifecycle
