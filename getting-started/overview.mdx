## What is Pipecat?

Pipecat is a framework for building voice-enabled, real-time, multimodal AI applications. "Multimodal" means you can use any combination of audio, video, images, and/or text in your interactions. And "real-time" means that things are happening quickly enough that it feels conversationalâ€”a "back-and-forth" with a bot, not submitting a query and waiting for results.

## How It Works

The flow of interactions in a Pipecat application is typically straightforward:

1. The bot says something
2. The user says something
3. The bot says something
4. The user says something

This continues until the conversation naturally ends. While this flow seems simple, making it feel natural requires sophisticated real-time processing.

### Real-time Processing

Consider what happens when the bot needs to respond:

1. Transcribe the user's speech as they're talking
2. Process the transcription through an LLM
3. Convert the response to speech
4. Play the audio to the user

To make this feel natural, Pipecat:

- Processes the LLM response as it streams in
- Starts generating speech for the first sentence while receiving later sentences
- Begins playback while preparing subsequent audio

This parallel processing creates fluid, natural conversations without noticeable delays.

## Key Features

### Real-time Processing

- Frame-based pipeline architecture for processing real-time data
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous processing
- Built-in frame synchronization for multimodal applications

### Voice-first Design

- Native support for speech recognition
- Real-time text-to-speech conversion
- Voice activity detection
- Natural conversation handling

### Flexible Pipeline Architecture

```python
# Example of a voice assistant pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),     # Receives audio input
    transcriber,          # Converts speech to text
    llm_processor,        # Generates responses
    tts_service,         # Converts text to speech
    transport.output()    # Plays audio output
])
```

### Service Integration

- Native support for popular AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- WebRTC integration through Daily.co
- Extensible service architecture for custom integrations

## What You Can Build
